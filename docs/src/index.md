# PSfs.jl Documentation
This toolbox aims at fast and accurate calculations of point spread functions (PSFs) as used in optics. It is particularyl
suited for high numerical aperture PSfs and vectorial aspects of the electric field. 
Aplanatic factors as for aplanatic optical systems fullfilling the Abbe sine condition are accounted for as well as
various pupil properties can be supplied. 
Different modes of calculation are possible and more will be added in the future. Aberrations can be specified in terms of Zernike coefficients.
